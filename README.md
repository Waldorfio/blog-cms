# Blog CMS

The CMS (Content Management System) front-end of the blog-client, developed using React.  
The CMS can be accessed via port 3001 at `http://localhost:3001` once the app is running.  

Refer to the main front-end [README.md](https://github.com/Waldorfio/blog-client#readme) for information on setting up the app.
